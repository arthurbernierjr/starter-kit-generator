# Quick Guide: Starting Your React Project with Big Poppa Code React Starter Kit

Discover an intuitive and lightweight environment to kickstart your journey with React and SASS using the Big Poppa Code React Starter Kit. This project not only provides a template generator for your React projects but also ensures a hands-on learning experience.

## Simple Steps to Launch Your React Project

1. **Initial Setup:** Execute `sudo npm i -g big-poppa-code-react-starter` in your command line. This installs the `lets-code` command globally on your computer.

2. **Project Creation:** Run `lets-code` in your desired parent directory. For instance, if you have a projects folder, use `lets-code` within that directory.

3. **Project Initiation:** Confirm the creation of a React project by selecting `get started`. You can exit anytime using CTRL + C.

4. **Naming Your Project:** Choose a project name, which will be used for the directory.

5. **Installation and Setup:** The template gets copied automatically, and `npm install` and `npm audit` run in the background. Note: package installation is automatic.

6. **Final Steps:** After the build, you'll see npm outputs, including any vulnerabilities, followed by instructions to start your project.

7. **Launching the Project:** Navigate to your project directory using `cd` and begin your development journey.
